# Video Analysis and Summarization System

## Overview
This system analyzes videos by combining visual and audio information to generate comprehensive summaries using AI models.

## Solution Approach

### 1. Video Frame Extraction
- Extract frames from the video at 1-second intervals
- Store frames in a structured format for processing
- Each frame represents a key moment in the video

### 2. Visual Analysis
- Feed extracted frames to Google's Gemini Pro Vision model
- Generate descriptions for each frame
- Capture visual context and important elements in each frame

### 3. Audio Processing
- Extract audio track from the video
- Convert audio to text using speech-to-text model
- Generate transcript of the audio content

### 4. Summary Generation
- Combine outputs from both visual and audio analysis:
  - Frame descriptions from Gemini Pro Vision
  - Transcribed text from audio
- Feed combined information to LLM model
- Generate comprehensive summary of the video content
